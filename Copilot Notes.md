## Word of Caution
> Always review the code generated by Copilot/GenAI for completion, accuracy, performance and compliance.
---
## Modes
- Ask
	- For asking questions without making updates to source code.
	- For general questions and getting code examples.
	- For learning about a topic.
- Edit
	- You want to make a quick, specific update to a defined set of files.
	- You want full control over the number of LLM requests Copilot uses.
- Agent
	- Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
	- You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
	- The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.

## Models
###  GPT Models

| Model           | Strengths                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT-4.1**     | Balanced general-purpose model for writing, coding, and reasoning            |
| **GPT-5-Codex** | Optimized for coding tasks; fast, accurate code completions and explanations |
| **GPT-5 mini**  | Lightweight version for quick, efficient general-purpose tasks               |

**Use cases:**
- Writing assistance (emails, essays, documentation)
- Code generation and explanation
- Fast responses for everyday tasks

###  Claude Sonnet Models

| Model                 | Strengths                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Advanced agent capabilities, strong reasoning, handles complex multi-step tasks |
| **Claude Sonnet 4**   | Deep reasoning, debugging, and architecture-level code analysis                 |
| **Claude Sonnet 3.5** | Fast, lightweight model for simple coding and documentation tasks               |

**Use cases:**
- Multi-agent workflows and planning
- Deep code analysis and debugging
- Quick help with syntax or repetitive tasks

### Summary
- **Fast, accurate coding help:** GPT-5-Codex or Claude Sonnet 3.5
- **Deep debugging or architectural analysis:** Claude Sonnet 4 or 4.5
- **General-purpose writing and coding:** GPT-4.1 or GPT-5 mini
- **Complex reasoning and agent tasks:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **GPT 4.1** - Great for really long documents or many files at once. It has a very large input window, so it will not run out of memory very quickly.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - great for writing / coding in general, but especially great for code review (its responses are generally "pedantic", so because it is so picky, it is very beneficial for code reviews).
- **GPT 5 Codex** - Great for tasks that require extensive planning. It has the ability to queue up a plan for itself and will mark the tasks as complete when they are done. However, it is not as good for code review.

## Providing Context
- Copilot extensions for all major IDEs Jetbrains, VS Code, Visual Studio provide visual attach option to add specific files and folders to context in addition to the open file in the editor.
- To provide specific files and folders as context, use **#** to see a drop down of options.
- To provide entire code base as context, some IDEs provide shortcuts below.
	-  @workspace (VS Code)
	- @project (IntelliJ)
	- @solution (Visual Studio)
---
## Prompt Engineering
- Providing a specific persona to use when responding to questions. 
  *Eg.* You're a senior software engineer who cares greatly about code quality, readability, and maintainability, can you review these code changes and provide comments/suggestions?
- Provide specific requirements.
- Break down complex tasks when asking for suggestions/code completion.
- Provide sufficient/optimal context, do not add entire workspace to context unless it's necessary.
  *Eg.* When asking to write a file import program, provide the sample file and if available desired structure of the imported models as context.

## Custom Instructions
- Repository
	- .github/copilot-instructions.md - *for global instructions*
	- .github/instructions/NAME.instructions.md - *for scoped instructions eg. frontend, backend*
	- AGENTS.md - *maintaining readable log of custom chatmodes*
- Organization (not available outside Enterprise plan)
- Personal (not available outside GitHub)
  *Examples*
	1. Always respond in Spanish.
	2. Your style is a helpful colleague, minimize explanations but provide enough context to understand the code.

---
## Commit Instructions

- .github/git-commit-instructions.md
  *Example*
>     When generating commit messages, extract the JIRA ticket id from the current branch, if present, and use it as a prefix for the summary of the commit message. JIRA Ticket ids are of the form: "ICSMFRSMAT-XXXXX". The body of the commit message should be a "change log" style summary of the changes. The commit message should look like this:
>     JIRA-TICKET: SUMMARY
>     - CHANGE description 1
>     - CHANGE description 2
---
## Custom Chatmodes
- *Personas and Roles* like front-end developer, security reviewer, solution architect, etc.
- *Specialized Tasks* like planning, code reviews, document generation.
- .github/chatmodes/<CHATMODE_NAME>.chatmode.md
