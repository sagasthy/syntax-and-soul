## Outline

Dad is a project manager at Google, discusses the project deadline and the deliverables when he gets a call from the principal at his son's school. He has to go talk to the management about his son's misbehaviour at a baseball match at school. Son gets suspended for a month and receives a warning. This makes the dad mad at his son, partly because he felt embarrassed by the way the principal spoke, doesn't say a word while driving him home, asks him to get down at home and says, "I felt ashamed for the first time in my life, because of you" and leaves.

He comes back from work late at night and finds out from his wife, that the son took it to heart and won't come out of his room. He realizes he might have overreacted at that moment, which he shouldn't have. He goes to the boy's room, calls him to have dinner. The boy doesn't say a word, the father tries again, yet nothing. He then lifts him, though with a little difficulty, carries him to the car, asks him to get in and signals to the wife that they're leaving for a trip. Wife keeps smiling throughout the whole thing.

Father looks at the boy and admits his reaction was a bit too much. The son says, "you have no idea how hurting your words were". Dad sighs and takes a pause. Recalling his teenage memories, he turns to the son and the conversation goes:

**Dad**: What you did today reminded me of an incident in my school. When I was in 8th grade, we had this cricket match with our seniors

Son: Wait, you played cricket? I didn't know that.

Dad: You did, you saw pictures with me playing cricket, when you were little and asked about it. That said, let me tell you the story. There was this friend of mine, who hit all the deliveries of a senior which spun up some fire on the field, you'd know how that happens (sarcastically looking at him)

Son: Duh

Dad: So, there was some exchange of words between the senior and him, and he punched him in the face after the senior said some swear words. They were summoned by the PT for an explanation.

Son: I see what you did there, they were suspended like me and their lives were spoiled forever?

Dad: I wouldn't be telling you if it was that simple, the senior conveniently lied to the PT trying to look innocent in the matter so the PT wouldn't believe my friend.
