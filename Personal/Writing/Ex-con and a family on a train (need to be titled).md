## Outline

An elderly man looks out a window of a train, looking at an old picture from his pocket. Gets a call a minute later, then gets off of the call saying "I'll be there at 7 am in the morning, don't come to the station, I'll take a cab home". Hearing this, a man smiles in a "been there" fashion. The old man smiles back at the man and his little baby girl in a warm manner. The baby's father initiates a talk by asking "Going to Chennai?". The old man replies "No, I'm going to Nellore". The conversation continues

Young man: Oh I used to go to Nellore as a kid, my uncle lived a couple miles from the station. It's been, what, 17 years.

Old man: That's a long time, things must have changed a lot (sighs tiredly and then looks at the father and the kid happily and asks) how old is she?

Young man: She's 6, Manu, introduce yourself to this thathayya, come on come on...

Little girl: Hello, my name is "Manaswini Dhulipala", I'm in 1st grade and I want to become a doctor when I'm big.

Old man: That's so lovely, why do you want to become a doctor, sweetheart?

Little girl: My granny was admitted in a hospital last week and the doctors don't let her eat what she likes. When I become a doctor, I will buy my patients chocolates, one truck full of them.

(Old man and young man laugh at that cute little ambition and a cafeteria assistant walks by selling biscuits, chocolates and drinks, Old man stops him and buys 2 long chocolate bars, puts one in his bag and offers the other one to the girl)

Old man: Here's one for you, you should surely become a doctor, take care of all your patients and most importantly eat all the chocolates in the world.

(The young man smiles too and couldn't say no to the chocolate, so lets her take it)

(After a while, the father and the kid open their packed dinner, start having it as they look at the old man staring out the window)

Young man: Aren't you having your dinner? It's 9 already.

Old man: I'm not that hungry, that's okay.

Young man: That's not okay, not having food is very bad for health, especially when you're older. Please share this curd rice, my mom had so much rice packed for just the two of us.

(Old man tries to say no, but can't fight the young man's persuasion, so ends up having some of it)

(They finish the dinner, wash the hands, while casually talking)

Old man: The girl was saying something about your mother earlier, was it serious?

Young man: She had a high blood pressure and was immediately admitted in the hospital before it escalated into something serious. That's I had to visit my parents, her mom couldn't come because of work commitments. Manu wanted to see her grand parents too, so I took her with me.

Old man: I'm glad your mom is fine, you showing up must have sped her recovery.

Young man: You know what, that's exactly what my mom said. So, did you come to Hyderabad to meet someone too?

Old man: Actually, uh, I came here 11 years ago for a school bus driver job. Unfortunately, things went sideways within a year of my joining and I got arrested.

(Young man starts looking less invested in the conversation after he hears this)

I'm going to meet my family for the first time in 11 years.

(The young man keeps nodding as if he wasn't interested in hearing his story)

Young man: Okay sir, actually I'm a bit sleepy and need to go to work tomorrow. So, uh, good night, I guess.

Old man: Absolutely, good night

When it's early in the morning, the old man tries to get down to the lower berth, sits in the seat and smiles at the young man and his kid, the kid says "good morning thathayya", but the father doesn't say a word, nor a smile. The old man gets what may be going on in the young man's mind, meanwhile the old man's station is next. He gets up, picks up his bag and signals bye to the little girl. The little girl notices a chocolate bar fell off the bag, so picks it up and hands it over to the old man and says "Thathayya, you dropped this, what will you do if you get hungry later?". The old man smiles and replies, "this is not for myself sweetheart, this is for kid, she loves chocolates too, just like you". The girl smiles and gives it to him. The old man leaves. As the train starts moving again, the young man sees the old man's daughter hugging him and crying as if she missed him a lot. Seeing this, the young man feels he may have been stupid to judge him of the little he knew about him.
